<h2>Mission and Scope</h2>
<p>Harborlight Waterwise exists to make water efficiency measurable and practical for readers across the United States. We believe that meaningful conservation requires more than good intentions; it requires systematic approaches that produce verifiable results. Our mission is to provide clear, actionable guidance that helps homeowners and small facility managers reduce water consumption while maintaining or improving the quality of their water-dependent activities.</p>
<p>The scope of our guidance encompasses residential properties, small commercial facilities, and light institutional buildings where water management decisions are typically made by owners or managers without specialized engineering support. We address indoor water use including fixtures, appliances, and leak detection; outdoor water use including irrigation systems and landscape choices; and the measurement and verification practices that distinguish genuine efficiency from wishful thinking.</p>
<h3>What We Do Not Cover</h3>
<p>Harborlight Waterwise does not provide engineering design services, and our content should not be interpreted as professional engineering advice. We do not offer legal guidance regarding plumbing code compliance, permit requirements, or regulatory obligations. For projects involving significant plumbing modifications, irrigation system design, or questions about code compliance, we encourage readers to consult licensed professionals in their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>We also do not cover large-scale industrial water use, agricultural irrigation beyond residential-scale applications, or municipal water system management. These domains involve specialized considerations beyond our editorial scope and expertise.</p>
<h3>Our Baseline-First Philosophy</h3>
<p>The foundation of our approach is establishing accurate baselines before recommending changes. Too often, water efficiency advice focuses on installing new equipment without first understanding current consumption patterns, identifying existing problems, or establishing metrics for measuring improvement. This approach leads to disappointing results and wasted investments.</p>
<p>We advocate starting every efficiency project with data collection: gathering historical consumption records, reading meters directly, testing for leaks, and understanding how water use divides between indoor and outdoor applications and among different household activities. Only with this baseline established can you make informed decisions about which improvements will deliver meaningful returns and verify that implemented changes actually produce expected savings.</p>
<p>This philosophy extends to how we present information. Rather than simply listing efficient products, we explain how to evaluate whether a particular upgrade makes sense for your situation, how to calculate expected savings based on your actual usage patterns, and how to verify results after implementation. We believe readers deserve guidance that helps them think critically about efficiency claims rather than simply accepting manufacturer marketing.</p>
<h3>The US Context</h3>
<p>Harborlight Waterwise focuses specifically on the United States context because water efficiency programs, regulations, and conditions vary significantly between countries. The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/watersense" rel="noopener">EPA WaterSense program</a> provides the primary certification framework for efficient fixtures in the US market. State and local plumbing codes establish minimum efficiency requirements that have evolved substantially over the past three decades. Utility rebate programs, drought restrictions, and water pricing structures differ not only between states but often between neighboring municipalities.</p>
<p>By maintaining a US focus, we can provide specific, relevant guidance rather than generic advice that may not apply to our readers' actual circumstances. We reference US measurement units, US regulatory programs, and US market conditions throughout our content. Readers outside the United States may find our general principles useful but should verify that specific programs, products, and regulations apply in their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Climate conditions across the United States range from water-abundant regions where efficiency is primarily an economic consideration to severely drought-prone areas where conservation is essential for community resilience. The <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/" rel="noopener">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> provides climate data and drought monitoring that can help readers understand their regional water supply context. We encourage readers to consider both immediate cost savings and long-term resilience when evaluating efficiency investments.</p>

<h2>Sourcing, Review, and Updates</h2>
<p>Editorial credibility depends on transparent sourcing practices and systematic review processes. Harborlight Waterwise maintains clear standards for the sources we rely upon and the verification steps we apply before publishing guidance.</p>
<h3>Source Hierarchy</h3>
<p>We prioritize primary sources from government agencies and academic institutions. Federal agencies like the EPA, USGS, Department of Energy, and <a href="https://www.usbr.gov/" rel="noopener">Bureau of Reclamation</a> provide authoritative data on water use patterns, efficiency program standards, and conservation technologies. University extension services, particularly from land-grant institutions, offer practical guidance developed through research and field testing.</p>
<p>For context and background information, we consult reputable reference sources including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_efficiency" rel="noopener">Wikipedia articles on water efficiency topics</a> and coverage from major news organizations. We use these sources to supplement rather than replace primary agency and academic references, and we verify key claims against original sources whenever possible.</p>
<p>We avoid relying on manufacturer claims without independent verification, affiliate-driven content that may prioritize commission potential over reader benefit, and sources with obvious commercial bias. When we mention specific products or programs, we do so based on documented performance characteristics rather than promotional relationships.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Transparency about sources allows readers to evaluate guidance critically and access original materials for deeper investigation. We link to our sources so you can verify our interpretations and stay current as programs evolve."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Review and Update Cadence</h3>
<p>We review all published content on a quarterly basis to identify information that may have become outdated. Federal programs occasionally modify eligibility criteria, efficiency standards evolve, and new research may refine best practice recommendations. Our quarterly reviews check for these changes and update content accordingly.</p>
<p>For major program changes—such as significant modifications to WaterSense criteria or widely-applicable regulatory updates—we implement immediate updates rather than waiting for scheduled reviews. We monitor agency announcements and industry publications to identify changes that warrant prompt attention.</p>
<p>Each page displays a last-reviewed date so readers can assess content currency. If you notice information that appears outdated or incorrect, we welcome feedback through the contact approach described below.</p>
<h3>Conflict of Interest Policy</h3>
<p>Harborlight Waterwise does not accept paid product placements, sponsored content, or affiliate compensation. Our recommendations are based solely on our assessment of what will help readers achieve their efficiency goals. We do not receive compensation from manufacturers, retailers, or service providers for mentioning their products or services.</p>
<p>If this policy ever changes, we will clearly disclose any commercial relationships that might influence our content. Readers deserve to know whether recommendations reflect editorial judgment or financial incentives.</p>

<h2>Contact Approach (Static Site)</h2>
<p>Harborlight Waterwise operates as a static website without server-side processing or database functionality. This architecture provides fast page loads, strong security, and minimal hosting complexity, but it means we cannot process form submissions or provide interactive features that require server communication.</p>
<h3>How to Reach Us</h3>
<p>For questions, corrections, or feedback about our content, you may contact us via email at contact at harborlightwaterwise dot com. We read all messages but cannot guarantee individual responses, particularly for questions that would require personalized consulting rather than general information.</p>
<p>We are not able to provide individualized advice about specific properties, diagnose problems remotely, or recommend contractors in your area. For these needs, we encourage you to consult local resources including your water utility, licensed plumbers, and irrigation professionals familiar with your region.</p>
<h3>When to Consult Professionals</h3>
<p>While our guidance helps readers understand water efficiency principles and implement straightforward improvements, some situations require professional expertise. Consult a licensed plumber for any work involving supply line modifications, water heater installation, or repairs beyond simple fixture replacement. Consult a licensed irrigation professional for system design, major repairs, or backflow prevention device installation and testing.</p>
<p>For questions about local code requirements, permit obligations, or mandatory conservation restrictions, contact your local building department or water utility. The <a href="https://www.usa.gov/" rel="noopener">USA.gov</a> website can help you locate appropriate government contacts. For health-related water quality concerns, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/" rel="noopener">CDC Healthy Water program</a> provides guidance on safe drinking water and household water system maintenance.</p>
<p>We believe that understanding when to seek professional help is as important as knowing what you can accomplish independently. Our goal is to help readers become informed consumers of professional services, able to ask good questions and evaluate recommendations critically, while handling routine efficiency improvements confidently on their own.</p>
